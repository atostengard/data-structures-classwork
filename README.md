# data-structures-classwork
Includes two examples of programs written in Java for a data structures class written according to a class API. Both require the Princeton algs package to run.

The first folder includes an implementation of an autocomplete function similar to what would be used in a search engine or text editor, using binary search to find potential matches.

The second folder includes an implementation of a suffix trie.
